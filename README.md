This project uses Dotenv to store environment variables. If you wish to use this repo, please complete the following steps: 1. Create two .env files to store the names of you databases: .env.test and .env.development 2. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). 4. Please ensure the .env files are .git.ignored 4. Run npm install - the dotenv will be automatically installed and you should now be able to run it.

Thank you for reading!
